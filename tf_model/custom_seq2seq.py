    """RNN decoder with attention for the sequence-to-sequence model.

    In this context "attention" means that, during decoding, the RNN can look up
    information in the additional tensor attention_states, and it does this by
    focusing on a few entries from the tensor. This model has proven to yield
    especially good results in a number of sequence-to-sequence tasks. This
    implementation is based on http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7449 (see below for
    details). It is recommended for complex sequence-to-sequence tasks.

    Args:
      decoder_inputs: A list of 2D Tensors [batch_size x input_size].
      encoder_inputs: A list of 2D Tensors [batch_size x input_size].
      initial_state: 2D Tensor [batch_size x cell.state_size].
      attention_states: 3D Tensor [batch_size x attn_length x attn_size].
      cell: rnn_cell.RNNCell defining the cell function and size.
      output_size: Size of the output vectors; if None, we use cell.output_size.
      num_heads: Number of attention heads that read from attention_states.
      loop_function: If not None, this function will be applied to i-th output
        in order to generate i+1-th input, and decoder_inputs will be ignored,
        except for the first element ("GO" symbol). This can be used for decoding,
        but also for training to emulate http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03099.
        Signature -- loop_function(prev, i) = next
          * prev is a 2D Tensor of shape [batch_size x output_size],
          * i is an integer, the step number (when advanced control is needed),
          * next is a 2D Tensor of shape [batch_size x input_size].
      dtype: The dtype to use for the RNN initial state (default: tf.float32).

        outputs: A list of the same length as decoder_inputs of 2D Tensors of
          shape [batch_size x output_size]. These represent the generated outputs.
          Output i is computed from input i (which is either the i-th element
          of decoder_inputs or loop_function(output {i-1}, i)) as follows.
          First, we run the cell on a combination of the input and previous
          attention masks:
            cell_output, new_state = cell(linear(input, prev_attn), prev_state).
          Then, we calculate new attention masks:
            new_attn = softmax(V^T * tanh(W * attention_states + U * new_state))
          and then we calculate the output:
            output = linear(cell_output, new_attn).
        state: The state of each decoder cell the final time-step.
          It is a 2D Tensor of shape [batch_size x cell.state_size].

    """Embedding sequence-to-sequence model with attention.

    This model first embeds encoder_inputs by a newly created embedding (of shape
    [num_encoder_symbols x input_size]). Then it runs an RNN to encode
    embedded encoder_inputs into a state vector. It keeps the outputs of this
    RNN at every step to use for attention later. Next, it embeds decoder_inputs
    by another newly created embedding (of shape [num_decoder_symbols x
    input_size]). Then it runs attention decoder, initialized with the last
    encoder state, on embedded decoder_inputs and attending to encoder outputs.

    Warning: when output_projection is None, the size of the attention vectors
    and variables will be made proportional to num_decoder_symbols, can be large.

    Args:
      encoder_inputs: A list of 1D int32 Tensors of shape [batch_size].
      decoder_inputs: A list of 1D int32 Tensors of shape [batch_size].
      cell: rnn_cell.RNNCell defining the cell function and size.
      num_encoder_symbols: Integer; number of symbols on the encoder side.
      num_decoder_symbols: Integer; number of symbols on the decoder side.
      embedding_size: Integer, the length of the embedding vector for each symbol.
      num_heads: Number of attention heads that read from attention_states.
      output_projection: None or a pair (W, B) of output projection weights and
        biases; W has shape [output_size x num_decoder_symbols] and B has
        shape [num_decoder_symbols]; if provided and feed_previous=True, each
        fed previous output will first be multiplied by W and added B.
      feed_previous: Boolean or scalar Boolean Tensor; if True, only the first
        of decoder_inputs will be used (the "GO" symbol), and all other decoder
        inputs will be taken from previous outputs (as in embedding_rnn_decoder).
        If False, decoder_inputs are used as given (the standard decoder case).
      dtype: The dtype of the initial RNN state (default: tf.float32).
      scope: VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to
        "embedding_attention_seq2seq".
      initial_state_attention: If False (default), initial attentions are zero.
        If True, initialize the attentions from the initial state and attention
        states.
      copy: If True use a copy mechanism in decoding to copy from encoder inputs
      attn_type: Attn type to use
    Returns:
      A tuple of the form (outputs, state), where:
        outputs: A list of the same length as decoder_inputs of 2D Tensors with
          shape [batch_size x num_decoder_symbols] containing the generated
          outputs.
        state: The state of each decoder cell at the final time-step.
          It is a 2D Tensor of shape [batch_size x cell.state_size].
